# Q: Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

# A: The client, Driverpass,  requested a web-based system, developed with the goal of assisting students to succeed on their driving exams. This is accomplished through providing online courses and practices tests for the students, as well as in-person driving lessons. The system allows for students to take their complete their courses, attempt their practice tests, track their progress, and scehdule their driving lessons online. The system also has the ability to alert DriverPass staff of any changes made to the DMV's material so they can act to update their course offerings to keep them up to date. 

# Q: What did you do particularly well?

# A: I feel I did well understanding the requirements the client set forth and understanding the requirements that the client would need based on their expectations for the       system. Knowing the requirements a system needs not only comes from what the client explicitly says but also considering the functionality the client expects. 

# Q: If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

# A: I would like to review the technical requirements for the system. That was an area that I feel I lacked in. First I would spend time reviewing the different classifications of technical requirements and how they could relate to the DriverPass system and reviewing the system requirements for DriverPass. Once I have felt confident in the associations between the technical and system requirements, then I revisit the technical requirements section and adjust it appropriately. 

# Q: How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

# A: When interpreting the user’s needs, I first began by considering what features the system was going to provide. Once I had compiled the list of features, I then separated those features based on which users would need them. I then tried to imagine using the system from each user’s perspective. I asked myself questions such as, “What features would be most important to the user?”, “Which features should be connected?”, etc. Considering the user’s needs helps to drive the design of the system. Putting features that the user will need to access often on their home page, and features that may be used less often or that could be considered a sub-feature of another could be placed on a different page, or not directly in the user’s view on their home page.

# Q: How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

# A: When designing software, understanding what the software is trying to accomplish and how it aims to accomplish those goals are the first steps that need to be taken. This is where requirements are established. Understanding the requirements for the system can help serve as a guideline for building the system itself. Knowing the requirements can help you design the diagrams for the different aspects of the system, such as process flows, use cases, and classes diagrams. These diagrams each serve a different purpose and can be used for a visual reference for designers and developers to ensure that they meet the requirements of the system. In the future I will be implementing collecting requirements and creating diagrams to help me keep track of systems. Utilizing the diagrams to create a workflow or using something like a Trello board to help me keep track of each requirements and keep me on task and help prevent me from deviating off into an area that should be developed later
